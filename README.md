Material related to MS certification 70-461 "Querying Microsoft SQL Server 2012"

I'm working my way through the Microsoft Press Training Kit for this exam. The files contain examples and exercises from the book, organized by chapter and lesson.

When better organized and tagged, this should also serve as a database of sample queries for use in interview tests (where permitted, of course) and on-the-job reference.
